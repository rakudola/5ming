# C-Half
Software to visually organize PEAKS peptide analysis for protein unfolding

## Current Version
v2.7.2 (2020/2/28)
- Development ended on HD input; now only accepts CD input
- Minor bug fixes
- Input now taken almost entirely from input file automatically

## Goals
- [x] Allow for multiple condition/replicate analysis without copy-pasting code (c. 2020/1/21)
- [x] Name this software (c. 2020/2/21)
- [x] Allow for .csv input (in case not using PEAKS) if correct headers (c. 2020/2/28)
- [ ] Better documentation (2020/1/21)
- [ ] Modification frequency + cleaning up and consolidating files (2019/9/24)
- [ ] Analyze PEAKS output directly (2019/10/24)
- [ ] Option to combine replicates to single curve (2019/10/24)
- [ ] r^2 value (2019/11/14)*
- [ ] C 1/2 value in range - 0 <  C 1/2 < 3.48 (2019/11/14)*
- [ ] C 1/2 vs. location of peptide graphs (2019/11/14)*
- [ ] Match non-unique peptides to their respective proteins (2019/11/26)**
- [ ] Allow run analysis even if missing replicates/conditions (2019/11/26)**
