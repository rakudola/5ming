Python code to visually organize PEAKS peptide analysis for protein unfolding

## Current Version
v2.5.4 (2019/1/17)
- Added delta_calculation function; only works for 2 conditions at the moment

## Goals
- [ ] Rewrite/debug functions only working with 2-condition, 4-replicate runs (2019/12/5)
- [ ] Allow for multiple condition/replicate analysis without copy-pasting code
- [ ] Name this software
- [ ] Check/fix delta calculations (2019/9/24)
- [ ] Modification frequency + cleaning up and consolidating files (2019/9/24)
- [ ] Analyze PEAKS output directly (2019/10/24)
- [ ] Allow for .csv input (in case not using PEAKS) if correct headers (2020/1/17)
- [ ] Option to combine replicates to single curve (2019/10/24)
- [ ] r^2 value (2019/11/14)*
- [ ] C 1/2 value in range - 0 <  C 1/2 < 3.48 (2019/11/14)*
- [ ] C 1/2 vs. location of peptide graphs (2019/11/14)*
- [ ] Match non-unique peptides to their respective proteins (2019/11/26)**
- [ ] Allow run analysis even if missing replicates/conditions (2019/11/26)**
