Python code to visually organize PEAKS peptide analysis for protein unfolding

## Current Version
v2.5.0 (2019/12/5)

## Current Long-Term Goals
- Allow for multiple condition/replicate analysis without copy-pasting code
- Name this software!

## Current Short-Term Goals
- Rewrite and debug plot_math function (2019/12/5)

## Future Goals
- Check/fix delta calculations (2019/9/24)
- Modification frequency + cleaning up and consolidating files (2019/9/24)
- Analyze PEAKS output directly (2019/10/24)
- Option to combine replicates to single curve (2019/10/24)
- r^2 value (2019/11/14)*
- C 1/2 value in range - 0 <  C 1/2 < 3.48 (2019/11/14)*
- C 1/2 vs. location of peptide graphs (2019/11/14)*
- Match non-unique peptides to their respective proteins (2019/11/26)**
- Allow run analysis even if missing replicates/conditions (2019/11/26)**
